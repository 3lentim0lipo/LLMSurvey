One day, he follows a young woman who sells plums and is captivated by her scent. He strangles her and tries to preserve her smell, but fails. He realizes that he needs to learn the art of perfumery to achieve his goal. He travels to Paris and meets Baldini, a once-famous perfumer who is now struggling to compete with his rivals. Grenouille impresses Baldini with his talent and becomes his apprentice. He learns how to distill and extract oils from various materials, but finds that none of them can capture the essence of human beings.
 
He decides to leave Paris and head to Grasse, the center of the perfume industry, where he hopes to find a method that can preserve human scents. Along the way, he encounters a lavender farmer who teaches him about enfleurage, a technique that involves covering flowers with animal fat to absorb their fragrance. He also has a mystical experience in a cave, where he creates a perfume that reflects his own identity.
  
The film follows Grenouille's journey in Grasse, where he becomes obsessed with capturing the scent of young women. He kills several of them and uses enfleurage to collect their odors. He also becomes interested in Laura, the beautiful daughter of Richis, a wealthy merchant and the head of the town. He believes that she has the perfect scent that he needs to complete his masterpiece. He stalks her and plans to kill her on her birthday.
 
However, his crimes do not go unnoticed. The town is in a state of panic and suspicion. The authorities launch a massive manhunt to find the killer. They eventually track down Grenouille and arrest him. He is sentenced to death by torture in a public square. On the day of his execution, he uses his perfume on himself, which causes the entire crowd to fall in love with him. They declare him innocent and beg for his forgiveness. He also uses his perfume on Richis and Laura's corpse, which makes them embrace each other as if they were alive.
 
Grenouille escapes from the scene and returns to Paris. He realizes that his perfume has given him everything he could ever want, except for one thing: the ability to love and be loved like a normal human being. He feels empty and hopeless. He decides to end his life by using his perfume on a group of beggars and thieves, who are overwhelmed by his scent and devour him alive. The film ends with a narration that says that Grenouille was killed \"out of love\".
